      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>
        Organizing a trip will be a series of steps consisting of details to help a user choose. 
        The first step is choosing a location and time. 
        This one is pretty much solely based on where the user wants to go, but a database of locations with tags could be added in the future. 
        The second step is choosing a trail in the park theyâ€™d like to go to. 
        These trails could have tags of features of the trails, like time to finish, difficulty of the trail, and pictures of the scenery. 
        The third step is picking a guide. 
        This step consists of a profile of each guide and the personality and experience to help the user choose. 
        The fourth step uses a list attached to the trail to provide a list of equipment and supplies needed. 
        Users can either use their own equipment or we can provide a kit for a price.
